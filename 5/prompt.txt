task_5_input.docx contains example of analyzing feedbacks to the post
 Analyze given feedbacks (Sample 1, Sample 2) according the example ONLY if they are relevant to the product, if not set false to isRelevant
and provide result in json format:
Sample 1: "Sensor just stops tracking for like a half second kinda often even at 8000hz. I've also tried it plugged in and still the same problem. First one I got I had to return also because the dongle just didnt work, $150 mouse btw"
Sample 2: "Is it worth it? It is a product with no flaws in my opinion, if you love it go for it, but its not worth the price since you'll be able to perform the same with a cheaper product with half the specs."
